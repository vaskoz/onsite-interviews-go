# Infinite Scroll List

The problem is to design an infinite scroll list like you'd see in a
webpage.

The implementation should know how many total sites are possible for a
list. Then *AddSites* is called to add more to your current list. Your
list should be able to answer questions about sites not yet loaded too.
